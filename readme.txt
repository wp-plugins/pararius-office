Use this plugin to display properties out of the backoffice Pararius Office
on your website.

== Description ==

This plugin is an extension of the backoffice Pararius Office, which is used by
real estate brokers to manage their properties. Via this plugin, a WordPress
designer can display all the properties of that broker easily on his website.
An API key is required for it to work, so it's no use for people who are no
customer of Anno MMX. You also need to have JSON natively installed on your
webserver. Wordpress does offer a replacement for this, but it's way too slow

== Installation ==

1. Upload `parariusoffice/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
